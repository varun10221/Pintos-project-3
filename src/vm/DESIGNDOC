 mmap-simple: a ``bare bones'' mmap test: mmaps and munmaps without actually accessing
   the memory. A handy way to see whether or not your mmap syscalls are getting their

The `struct page' includes a 'void *location' and a 'enum page_status status'.
These fields are protected by the 'struct lock' of the page. 

When a process page faults, it calls supp_page_table_find_page, which goes
and locates the page associated with the faulting address. To do this it must
first locate the segment to which the page belongs, by comparing the faulting address
to the 'start' and 'end' boundaries of the segment. Once the matching page is found...
 
If status == PAGE_RESIDENT, then location points to the `struct frame' containing it.

Otherwise, a frame is allocated and the page's contents have to be found.
  If status == PAGE_SWAPPED_OUT, location points to the `struct swap_slot' containing it.
  If status == PAGE_IN_FILE (mmap or executable), it is read from the backing file.
  If status == PAGE_STACK_NEVER_ACCESSED, it is zero'd out.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between

For memory sharing, each page maintains a list of struct page_owner_info's.
This structure includes the thread *owner and the void *vpg_addr so that
the corresponding pagedir entry for each process can be queried.

The pages are only modified through the user virtual addresses, so querying
the vpg_addr of each owner is sufficient.

One exception is in reading executable pages from the file: some of these pages
must be zero'd out. This zero'ing is done from the kernel address so as not
to affect the user virtual addresses access or dirty bits.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

Each frame has a lock field to ensure mutex on accesses to the frame.
To find a new frame, processes call frame_table_obtain_free_locked_frame. 
Processes first to look for a free frame, and if that fails they try to evict a page from its frame.
Either way, they lock the frame while they examine (and possibly use) it. 
A process unlocks the frame once it has placed the page in it -- at this point 
the supplemental page table and the frame table agree about the status, and eviction 
can take place if needed.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

My fundamental motivation was to implement executable sharing. 
In such a setting, the use of segments makes sense: multiple
processes define their own segments for a given shared region
(including, for example, different virtual addresses),
but the mappings (page -> frame/swap) contained in the segment can be shared.

The `struct page' itself then tracked not its virtual address, but rather
its relative page number in its segment. This meant that if two processes shared the same
mappings (e.g. an executable) but mapped it at different starting addresses, 
both would be able to find the page based on its address relative to the 
starting address of the segment.

The goal of sharing also meant that a `struct page' keeps a list of owners, allowing
us to use list functions to test the pagedir entry of each owner for dirty or accessed,
or to invalidate the pagedir entry when needed. Each entry in 'owners' included the
virtual page address in its owner's address space for querying of the pagedir.

The expectation is that many more pages than frames will exist, so avoiding wasted space was important.
I chose to track the location of the page using a combination of the page's `void *location' field
and its `status' field, rather than having a `void *paddr'. When a page was resident, its physical 
address could be obtained by accessing its frame. When not resident, we wouldn't be wasting 
the space for a `void *' in the `struct page'.

I also felt that putting the paddr directly into the page would violate modularity -- I wanted the
frame to define the physical location, rather than the page itself.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.
   
We use a basic clock algorithm to take care of eviction. The global frame 
table has a hand member, that starts at index zero and maintains it value, so 
that it points to the index, where eviction was last carried out. Whenever, a 
frame needs to evicted due to lack of free frames, the hand moves over the 
frame table skipping the PINNED FRAMES and inspecting the pagedirectory of the 
owners of the page in the frame, to find if the page is accessed or not. If 
the page is not accessed , it will be chosen for eviction, otherwise if its 
accessed the accesbit will be set to false and the search will continue until 
we land on an unaccessed page. Then the frame associated with the page will 
chosen for eviction an its content will be swapped out or written depending on 
the type of the page contained in the frame.   

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a

>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

Whenever a page gets evicted from a frame, the page and frame are locked by the
evicting process. The page's owners then have their pagedir entries cleared, causing
them to pagefault when they next try to access the page. The pagefault path requires
locking the page, so the faulting process must wait for the evicting process to finish.

The evicting process swaps out, writes back, or discards the page depending on its type.
It then updates the former page's details with its new location and status (swap or in the file).
This page is a member of the owner's supplemental page table, so the owner can now find out
where his page went.

Now when the page of the new process is stored in the frame, the frame's and
the newly-resident page's details like pg (for frame) and status+location (for page) are updated appropriately. 

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

At every transition from user to kernel mode, we call process_observe_stack_address.
These transitions are in page_fault and syscall_handler. Additionally, in setup_stack
we initialize the stack address to PHYS_BASE.

In process_observe_stack_address, if the observed address is lower than the thread's `void *min_observed_stack_address',
then we update the min_observed_stack_address field. 

Now that we have an up-to-date record of the lowest stack address...

In page_fault, if the user's access is below the min_observed_stack_address by no more than 32 bytes, 
then we update the stack address to the location of the access. 32 bytes was chosen because
that is how far below the stack a legal access can be (through use of the PUSHA instruction).

When looking for a segment (supp_page_table_find_segment), if we fail to find a segment
in which the address belongs, we then check if the min_observed_stack_address is at or below the virtual address being queried.
If it is, then we grow the stack by lowering the stack segment's `start' field to the virtual address.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

A page and a frame both have a lock. In order to manipulate a
page (owner, location, status) you need to hold the page's lock.
In order to manipulate a frame (pg) you need to hold the frame's lock.

The locking order is 
  lock page
  lock frame

This cannot be honored in the case of eviction, where first the
non-pinned frame is locked and then its page (if any) is locked.
To avoid deadlock, in eviction try_lock is used to lock the page,
and if the page cannot be locked then the frame is considered
unavailable. The next frame is examined. 

This leads to an imperfect clock eviction algorithm, since we don't examine 
the access bit of all pages, just the lock-able ones. Consequently, when 
searching for an eviction victim, we scan the list of frames up to 3 times times
looking for a victim. This gives us time to come back to pages that were locked,
in the event that we can't find any other pages to evict.

Other places where locking is used:
  - When getting a new swap slot, the swap table's usage_lock is acquired to protect
    access to the usage bitmap.

  - When evicting, the frame table's eviction_lock is acquired to protect the 'hand' field.
    This ensures that pages aren't unfairly evicted earlier than they should be (process 1 
    begins at hand and looks for a victim; process 2 begins at hand and evicts the very first page,
    already cleared by process 1).

  - Atomically updating the frame table's n_free_frames field.

None of these areas is a candidate for deadlock.

For memory sharing, see D2.

This was already described a bit in B3.

When evicting a page, the evicting process holds a lock on the frame and the page.
He then invalidates the page owners' pagedirs so that they will fault.
When one or more of those owners fault, they need to lock the page, 
so they are forced to wait for the evicting process to finish before they can
fault the page back in.

We ensure the elimination of the race condition, by using frame and page locks.
Whenever a page needs to be read in to the frame, a free locked frame is obtained
so that the data can be brought in. Further a page lock is also obtained on the page
read in so that no other page owner is trying to read the page in. Since the frame is
locked before transferring the data, we ensure that a second process cannot interfere;
any interfering process must lock the frame, and he cannot do that until we have put
the frame table and the supplemental page table into a consistent state.

I have two mechanisms to deal with this. 

1. When the user provides a file name as a string (create, remove, open), 
I use strlcpy to store the string in a kernel buffer (the thread 
member `void *scratch_page', allocated only if the process needs it). 
If the strlcpy triggers page fault(s), they are handled by page_fault.

This allows me to avoid pinning multiple pages at once in the event
that the user's string spans multiple pages.

Once the string is copied to the thread's kernel buffer, there is no
risk of page fault while calling the filesys commands under the filesys_lock.

2. When the user provides a buffer for I/O, I split the request into
pieces, one piece for each page that the buffer spans. For each piece
I pin the buffer to a frame and then am safe from page faults.

In the case of read, after pinning the relevant portion of the buffer
to a frame, I attempt to modify the first byte of that portion of the
buffer. This will cause a page fault if the buffer is read-only.
If no page fault occurs, I'm safe to acquire filesys_lock and do the IO.

Our VM design allows for high parallelism in finding a free frame, and 
low parallelism in eviction.

Free frames are searched for optimistically (find a frame with status EMPTY
and then lock it and confirm) so that multiple free frames can be found
simultaneously. The search for free frames begins at a random index each time
to mitigate the following scenario:

  P1: Locate free frame 0. Lock it and begin reading data back from swap.
  P2: Locate free frame 0. Try to lock it...wait for P1
  P1: Finish reading from swap and mark free frame 0 as OCCUPIED
  P2: Lock acquired. See P1 is OCCUPIED and keep looking.

If starting from the same index each time, this scenario is relatively likely.
By starting from a random index the scenario becomes less likely.
This seems to result in about a 5% performance improvement, averaged over 10
invocations of page-parallel, as compared to starting from 0 each time.

Locating a free frame is the ``fast path'' -- when the system is not heavily loaded,
there should be free frames available, and finding one needs to be as fast as possible.

On the other hand, if eviction is necessary than the system is fairly heavily loaded
already, so a further performance degradation seemed relatively inconsequential.
Thus, eviction is a sequential operation.  The operation of {clear access bits until 
you find a victim, then move hand} seems to need to be atomic to avoid unwisely evicting 
just-cleared pages. See B5 for more discussion. 
I suspect this bottleneck can be improved, but did not have time to address this.

I did make two concession to improving this path.
1. By keeping the frame table's n_free_frames field up to date, a process can quickly
see that there are no free frames (i.e. n_free_frames == 0) and proceed to
eviction without having to ``needlessly'' scan all of the frames. Of course a frame
could open up due to a process exiting, but this frame would be found by frame_table_get_eviction_victim
anyway.

2. The search for evictable frames is also optimistic: it skips frames marked pinned and only
locks frames that are empty or occupied. It then locks the frame and verifies its assessment
before proceeding to see if it has been accessed.

>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

Most of the page operations are treated the same, although eviction and release of mmap file pages are treated different
from the non-mmapped ones.

Each page includes a pointer to a segment_mapping_info, which includes an mmap_details, which has the file* and the offset in the file to which the
page belongs if it is an mmap'd page.

In case of a page-fault, based on the faulted address, we determine the page to which the address belongs. 
If the page is mmap'd, we retrieve the data from the appropriate offset in the file. 
If it's a stack page we zero out the memory. 
If it's swapped out, we swap the contents back in from the disk.

For eviction, if we evict a non-mmapped page then a free slot in swap is determined and then the contents are written out to swap.
If it's mmap'd and from the code segment of an executable page we discard it. For the text/bss segment we always swap it out.
If it's a 'normal' mmapped page, we check if the page is dirty and if so we write it back to the file. Otherwise we discard it.
 
>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

Each process's supplemental page table is a list of segments,
sorted by their starting offset. Given a new mapping request,
I take the start address and compute the end address based on the file size.
I then iterate over the existing segments and determine if the {start,end} pair
of the new segment overlaps with the {start,end} of each existing segments.
Because the list of segments is sorted, I don't always need to scan the entire
list, just far enough to see a segment whose start is greater than the proposed 
mapping's end.

The implementation of mmap mappings is strongly shared with the demand-paging
for executables. Demand paging is treated as a special form of mmap.
The backing type for normal mmap is MMAP_BACKING_PERMANENT, while the backing
type for executables is MMAP_BACKING_INITIAL. When evicting and loading,
this type is checked and we decide to swap out or write back or discard appropriately.

This means that if memory sharing works for read-only executable pages, it should
be a simple extension to allow it to work for sharing general mmap'd pages. 

This lets us re-use code and also makes the conceptual load required to understand the code easier. 
I thought it was cleaner to have a ``sub-type'' than to have two unrelated types with very similar
semantics.

Extra details required for mmapping from executables: 
1. Need to track read_bytes and zero_bytes in order to zero out the page properly.
2. Need to track the file offset at which the memory mapping begins.

>> D2: Describe how memory sharing works.

Segments can be one of two types: SEGMENT_PRIVATE and SEGMENT_SHARED.
Mappings can be created with either of these two types. At the moment
only mmap'd mappings can be shared, though it shouldn't be too hard to
extend to allow something like shmget.

When a SEGMENT_SHARED segment is created, its inode number and file offset are combined
to make a key into the ro_shared_mappings_table's mmap_details_to_shared_mappings hash.
If no such key exists, a new mapping is added. If such a key is already present, the
process's segment points to the existing shared_mappings struct residing in the
ro_shared_mappings_table's mmap_details_to_shared_mappings hash.

Reference counting is used to prevent memory leaks.

Each page maintains a list of owners; this is a list of `struct page_owner_info',
which provides enough information to interact with each owners' pagedir. That
way when a process goes to access a page in a SEGMENT_SHARED segment, it
adds itself to the list of owners of that page (protected by the page's lock).
This allows processes evicting shared pages to update all of the owners, and
similarly to check the dirty bit and the access bit across all owners of a page.

Removal and cleanup is done appropriately.

A single file* is used by all processes sharing a given memory mapping, and is
closed by the last person to use the shared_mappings structure.
As all file system operations are protected by filesys_lock, there is no risk
of a race between two processes both trying to use this file* to read from different
parts of the executable at once.

         SURVEY QUESTIONS
         ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

I thought this project was fairly demanding. Much of the effort went into
figuring out a design that would cleanly accommodate memory sharing, though,
and I think it would have been much easier had I not been trying to figure
out how to get that to work nicely.

Forgetting to clear the owner's pagedir on eviction led to some really
interesting bugs. That really illuminated a lot of the concepts for me.

I think the suggestion I posted on Pintos about keeping a cksum for a page
was a useful technique to automatically detect issues as a result of page
eviction. I think adding this as a hint in the assignment would be useful.

No.

>> Any other comments?

I think requiring us to evaluate the performance of different eviction algorithms 
would be a neat tweak/alternate suggestion for extra credit. So far we've focused
on building stuff but it would be cool to get a sense of the relative performance
of what we're building.

Alternatively, ``racing'' our implementations on the various tests
and putting up a scoreboard might be a fun way to motivate this organically.
